# AlphaProject

This is the code I used for the project.

The data was taken from this paper:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-14273-0

The data used is available through the immuneACCESS platform (10.21417/AR2019NC https://clients.adaptivebiotech.com/pub/reuben-2019-natcomms).

the python scripts (not the notebooks!) were used for parsing the metadata from each file
